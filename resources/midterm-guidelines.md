# Midterm - Impossible Maps 

## Overview 

Your assignment is to use all of the things that you've learned to make a slippy map. But I want you to create a map that answers a question. As in, use your map as a way to advance knowledge (cartographic, experiential, personal, social, etc) in some kind of way. For example, consider the types of questions that have informed these maps: 

- [What are all the different types of trees in NYC?](http://jillhubley.com/project/nyctrees/)
- [How fast is the LAFD where I live](http://graphics.latimes.com/how-fast-is-lafd/#11/34.1686/-118.5013)? (this is ambitious, but you get the idea)
- [Where are surveillance planes flying?](https://www.buzzfeed.com/peteraldhous/spies-in-the-skies?utm_term=.psp5aaemn#.lllxbb5MO) (Also way too ambitious)
- How do people conceive of space differently (think of the Here to Home exercises!)
- [How can we use a map to express lived inequalities](https://makingmaps.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/bunge_runovermap.jpg)?
- [What do different death penalty laws look like around the world?](http://lmj.io/projects/mapping/assignment-3/)  
- What is the average distance that I travel on foot in a day? (e.g., working with your moves data)
- If I could design an ideal building for x activity, what would it look like? 

And so on. These are examples, but you are free to interpret this idea less literally. Perhaps you want to create a map of something [seemingly unmappable](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/07/maps-what-your-city-smells-like/?utm_term=.ac06331cc1eb), or to play with the technical capabilities of vector vs raster tiles, or maybe you want to create an aesthetic experience of one particular feature. 

You must include a legend and a title on your map. Make it so that anyone coming across your map will understand immediately what it's about. You must also write up a documentation post that explains your thought process, what you did, etc etc. 

You will have to present your map in class on **October 18**. Projects will be assessed on intellectual rigor, level of effort, and how well they accomplish whatever task you have set out to do. 

Be ambitious, be creative, be intentional!  

## Presentations 

Your presentations will be 15 minutes long. You should budget 10 minutes for presenting, and at least 5 minutes for questions. Fortunately, because we have a small class, there's some flexibility if you go over time. 

For your presentation, walk us through it from start to finish. What was your idea? Why did you want to do it? How did you do it? What did you end up with as a final piece? What did you learn? 

You will need to have a **written documentation post** ([here](http://jillhubley.com/blog/nyctrees) is an example from a real-world project, though yours may be longer). Include pictures from the final piece and, if you like, process shots as well.
