# Midterm - Impossible Maps 

Your assignment is to use all of the things that you've learned to make a slippy map. But I want you to create a map that answers a question. As in, use your map as a way to advance knowledge (cartographic, experiential, personal, social, etc) in some kind of way. For example, consider the types of questions that have informed these maps: 

- [What are all the different types of trees in NYC?](http://jillhubley.com/project/nyctrees/)
- [How fast is the LAFD where I live](http://graphics.latimes.com/how-fast-is-lafd/#11/34.1686/-118.5013)? (this is ambitious, but you get the idea)
- [Where are surveillance planes flying?](https://www.buzzfeed.com/peteraldhous/spies-in-the-skies?utm_term=.psp5aaemn#.lllxbb5MO) (Also way too ambitious)
- How do people conceive of space differently (think of the Here to Home exercises!)
- [How can we use a map to express lived inequalities](https://makingmaps.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/bunge_runovermap.jpg)?
- [What do different death penalty laws look like around the world?](http://lmj.io/projects/mapping/assignment-3/)  
- What is the average distance that I travel on foot in a day? (e.g., working with your moves data)
- If I could design an ideal building for x activity, what would it look like? 

And so on. These are examples, but you are free to interpret this idea less literally. Perhaps you want to create a map of something [seemingly unmappable](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/07/maps-what-your-city-smells-like/?utm_term=.ac06331cc1eb), or to play with the technical capabilities of vector vs raster tiles, or maybe you want to create an aesthetic experience of one particular feature. 

You must include a legend and a title on your map. Make it so that anyone coming across your map will understand immediately what it's about. You must also write up a documentation post that explains your thought process, what you did, etc etc. 

You will have to present your map in class on **October 18**. Projects will be assessed on intellectual rigor, level of effort, and how well they accomplish whatever task you have set out to do. 

Be ambitious, be creative, be intentional!
