## Debugging:

The hard part about web maps is that there are a multitude of places where things can go wrong.

- If something isn't showing up, the first thing you should do is check the **Console** (accessed by clicking View > Developer > Javascript Console). Read the error messages, as they will help you with errors specifically related to missing files, oddities in your JS code, and so on.
- If your project is failing silently (i.e., not working but not providing any error messages), ask yourself the following questions:
  - Are the links to me external libraries and stylesheets correctly provided?
  - Am I starting my local server from the right directory?
  - Did I mispell the name of any files?
