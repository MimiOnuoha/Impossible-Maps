# Project - Impossible Maps

## Overview

Your assignment is to use all of the things that you've learned over the course of the semester to create a piece in conversation with the work of one of the community groups that takes the form of a  map, map-based, or otherwise geographica/spatial-centered object. You will work in groups of two. 

Over the course of the semester, we've talked about a number of different interesting issues and ideas, and you've been exposed to a number of interesting technologies. You don't have to engage *all* of them.  Choose whichever one has captivated you the most.

It may be useful for you to think of using this project as a way to answer a question, or advance some kind of knowledge, understanding, or inquiry (cartographic, spatially, artistically, aesthetically, culturally, etc). You will want to consider both intention and output, concept and execution. Consider not just how you will collect or acquire the data, but how you will communicate the project to people who haven't been sitting in our group all semester.  

You will be working in pairs, and will have a small budget for materials (about $200/group). Don't hesitate to let me know if you have questions! 



## Process

We'll be sharing all of our assets with the community groups, so please document and keep track of any datasets, materials, code, or inspiration that you use. 



## Presentations

You will be presenting your map to a group that consists of folks from the ISGM, Olin, and the community groups, and your piece will live for some time at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. This means that you need to have a degree of polish to your workâ€”don't wait until the last week to throw something together!

You will need to have a **written documentation post** ([here](http://jillhubley.com/blog/nyctrees) is an example from a real-world project, though yours may be longer) that is also due on **May 7**. Include pictures from the final piece and, if you like, process shots.
