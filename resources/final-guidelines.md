# Final - Impossible Maps

## Overview

Your assignment is to use all of the things that you've learned over the course of the semester to create some type of map, map-based, or otherwise geographic and spatial-centered object. Just as with your midterm, you should create a project that investigates an issue or attempts to answer a question. Use your map as a way to advance some kind of knowledge. In class, we often are interested in learning to use tools and considering what work they do and represent, but your final project must be an actual project. For instance, you cannot just take a drone out and gather images. But you *could* use a drone to compare 50 years of aerial imagery of one spot, for example. 

Over the course of the semester, we've talked about a number of different interesting issues and ideas, and you've been exposed to a number of interesting technologies. You don't have to engage *all* of them.  Choose whichever one has captivated you the most, and use it to advance a type of knowledge (cartographic, experiential, personal, social). 

You're welcome, also, to extend the midterm project you did, and push it to a more complete place. 

If you are creating a map,it must have a legend, a title, and be intelligible to someone approaching it for the first time. If you're creating a print, it should be the same way. Consider, as we always do, not just how you will collect or acquire the data, but also how you will communicate it to people approaching your project. 

You can work together or in groups. You'll have time to work in class on your map on **December 6**. On **December 13** you will need to present to the class (and hopefully some guest critics!). Just as with your midterm, you'll need to have a page of documentation explaining the project, why you did it the way you did, how. 

## Presentations

Your presentations will be 15 minutes long. You should budget 10 minutes for presenting, and at least 5 minutes for questions. Fortunately, because we have a small class, there's some flexibility if you go over time. 

For your presentation, walk us through it from start to finish. What was your idea? Why did you want to do it? How did you do it? What did you end up with as a final piece? What did you learn? 

You will need to have a **written documentation post** ([here](http://jillhubley.com/blog/nyctrees) is an example from a real-world project, though yours may be longer) that is also due on **December 13**. Include pictures from the final piece and, if you like, process shots as well.
