# Final - Impossible Maps

## Overview

Your assignment is to use all of the things that you've learned over the course of the semester to create some type of map, map-based, or otherwise geographic and spatial-centered object. Your assignment is to use all of the things that you've learned to make a slippy map. But I want you to create a map that answers a question. Use your map as a way to advance knowledge (cartographic, experiential, personal, social, etc) in some kind of way. For example, consider the types of questions that have informed these maps: 

- [What are all the different types of trees in NYC?](http://jillhubley.com/project/nyctrees/)
- [How fast is the LAFD where I live](http://graphics.latimes.com/how-fast-is-lafd/#11/34.1686/-118.5013)? (this is ambitious, but you get the idea)
- [Where are surveillance planes flying?](https://www.buzzfeed.com/peteraldhous/spies-in-the-skies?utm_term=.psp5aaemn#.lllxbb5MO) (Also way too ambitious)
- How do people conceive of space differently (think of the Here to Home exercises!)
- [How can we use a map to express lived inequalities](https://makingmaps.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/bunge_runovermap.jpg)?
- [What do different death penalty laws look like around the world?](http://lmj.io/projects/mapping/assignment-3/)  
- What is the average distance that I travel on foot in a day? (e.g., working with your moves data)
- If I could design an ideal building for x activity, what would it look like? 

And so on. These are examples, but you are free to interpret this idea less literally. Perhaps you want to create a map of something [seemingly unmappable](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/07/maps-what-your-city-smells-like/?utm_term=.ac06331cc1eb), or to figure out how to make your own map tiles, or maybe you want to create an aesthetic experience of one particular feature. All of these are acceptable. 

In other words: use your map as a way to advance some kind of knowledge. In class, we often are interested in learning to use tools and considering what work they do and represent, but your final project must be an actual project. For instance, you cannot just take a drone out and gather some images. But you *could* use a drone to compare 50 years of aerial imagery of one spot. The difference is in focus, intention, and the inherent question behind the latter. 

Over the course of the semester, we've talked about a number of different interesting issues and ideas, and you've been exposed to a number of interesting technologies. You don't have to engage *all* of them.  Choose whichever one has captivated you the most.

If you are creating a map, it must have a legend, a title, and be intelligible to someone approaching it for the first time. If you're creating a print, it should be the same way. Consider not just how you will collect or acquire the data, but how you will communicate the project to people approaching your project. 

You can work together or in groups. You will need to present to the class (and hopefully some guest critics!). You'll need to have a page of documentation explaining the project, why you did it the way you did, how. 

## Presentations

Your presentations should be about 7 minutes long.  For your presentation, walk us through your project from start to finish. What was your idea? Why did you want to do it? How did you do it? What did you end up with as a final piece? What did you learn? Feel free to use slides if you like. 

You will need to have a **written documentation post** ([here](http://jillhubley.com/blog/nyctrees) is an example from a real-world project, though yours may be longer) that is also due on **May 1**. Include pictures from the final piece and, if you like, process shots.
