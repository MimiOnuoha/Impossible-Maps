## Independent Study Description 

Digital technologies have created new opportunities and resources for mapping, cartography, and geolocation-based visual investigation. They have also brought with them the need to consider issues concerning power, representation, and space.

In this group independent study, a small group of students will partner with the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum and a number of community youth organizations to create pieces that consider the intersection of art, data, and space in new ways. Students will conceive of and gather creative information and datasets about Boston with the goal of collectively creating a series of objects that take the form of maps, models and manifestations. These creative objects will be shared with and presented at the Gardner They will ultimately serve as a form of research, visual inspiration, and raw material for the ISG Museumâ€™s Big Plans: Picturing Social Reform exhibition and Community Engagement program.

During the independent study, students  will learn the practical realities of working with spatial geographies in digital, physical, and web-based contexts. Much time will also be devoted to investigating a number of conceptual questions: 

- What makes a good digital or web map? 
- What do maps represent as visual information artifacts? 
- What happens when we consider claims to space as topics for art-based investigations? How can we subvert, reinvent, and respond to these claims?  

Students will gain exposure to a broad range of techniques in web and digital mapping, with the goal that they eventually focus on one or two. Throughout the course, students will be challenged to make maps (or map-based creations) that function as artful objects and challenge common conventions of the capabilities of maps. We will primarily use JavaScript, with assignments making use of git and Github. Other technologies taught will include mapshaper, Leaflet.js, Mapbox.js, and Carto. At the conclusion of the course, students will present (individually in groups) a map or map-based object to a team of critics. If these projects are judges as being strong enough, they will then be presented to stakeholders at the Gardner, where they will be on display to museum visitors.

## Expectations and Requirements
- Course attendance and punctuality 
- Participation during group discussions and presentations
- Weekly assignments + accompanying blogpost  
- Midterm and final project (completed individually or in groups)

This is an independent study, not a class. In the first six weeks or so, it may be difficult to tell why this has been designated an independent study, as you will be expected to complete readings, discussion, and assignments like a typical class. I would suggest you think of this more as a research group: a chance to learn some foundational material, and then pursue the research and technical topics that are most intriguing to you. Over the second half of the semester, the distinction will become clearer. You will work on one project, and you will be expected to come bearing  a high degree of motivation and self-direction. You will be expected to engage with one another's work both inside and out of our group. We will elaborate on what this looks like practically the first time we meet. 

In addition, a degree of flexibility will be required over the course of the semester, as we will be working alongside others and schedules may need to shift last minute. None of this should affect you outside of our meeting time, but it means that the syllabus below may shift. 

This is intended to be an inclusive and harassment-free space for everyone, with no tolerations of discrimination based on gender, race, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or appearance. Please feel free to let me know privately if you have an academic accommodation.  All students are allowed a maximum of one absence. 

Homework should be submitted  **the night before** before we meet. This will provide me time to look at your work, provide feedback, and structure the class in response to what you've submitted. 


## Evaluation
Final evaluation will be based on the completion of all assignments, class participation, quality of work, and attendance. 

## Format 
Our sessions will be different each week, though each week in the first half of the IS will be oriented around a central theme and accompanied by some exploration of a digital mapping technology or concept. All assignments and readings will be posted through the class GitHub repository.

## Syllabus
**WEEK ONE** (Jan 23): Introductions      
*Introductions to class and to each other/semester set-up:  What is a map, what is the history of mapping, what the different parts of a web map do and what they can be used for, what are impossible maps?* 

ASSIGNMENT: 
This week's assignment is about diving into readings and allowing you to assess your comfort with some of the tools we'll be using over the semester. 

  - Go through [this](http://maptime.io/anatomy-of-a-web-map/#0) (may take a minute to load properly)
  - Read (in this order, all from readings folder):
    - *On Exactitude in Science*, Borges 
    - excerpt from *The Precession of Simulacra*, Baudrillard
    - *Experimental Geography*, Paglen  
  - In the [week1](https://github.com/MimiOnuoha/Impossible-Maps/tree/master/week1) folder, find the  base map or extended base map file. Use the Leaflet documentation to change the view and zoom of the map and add a popup or marker. Get the map online and post it to your blog or website (which you should create for this class). 
  - In addition to the map, post at least 200 words on our thoughts about the readings, the process of creating your first web map, or anything that we talked about in class. What interests you about maps, space, and the representation of both digitally? You can write anything, but you must post to your blog and post the link to the [Assignments](https://github.com/MimiOnuoha/Impossible-Maps/wiki/Assignments) wiki. 


**WEEK TWO**  (Jan 30):  The Perils of Web Mapping    
*Slippy web maps, the differences between Leaflet and Mapbox and vector vs raster tiles.  What is geodata, how do we create it and add it to our maps?* 

**WEEK THREE** (Feb 6): Thinking Poetically about Mapping
*In light of our partnership with the ISG and community groups, we consider poetic approaches to mapping and space.*

**WEEK FOUR** (Feb 13): Visit to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum   
*We meet our collaborators and stakeholders at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum and get a tour of the space.*

**WEEK FIVE** (Feb 27): A Sense of Place (+ design considerations)  
*Changing geodata into useful forms, working with multiple datasets, design considerations for our maps.*

**WEEK SIX** (March 6): Counter-Mapping as Practice   
*Exploring aerial imagery and the material experience of mapping.* 

**WEEK NINE** (March 13): The View from Above    
*Satellite data and mapping* 

**WEEK TEN**(March 27): Project Proposals     

**WEEK ELEVEN**(April 3): Work on projects - no group meeting this week. 

**WEEK TWELVE** (May 1): Final Presentations  to internal cries 

**WEEK THIRTEEN** (May 7): Final Presentations to the ISG and community groups
