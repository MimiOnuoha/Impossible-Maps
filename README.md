## Course Description 

Digital technologies have created new opportunities and resources for mapping, cartography, and geolocation-based visual investigation. They have also brought with them the need to consider issues concerning power, representation, and space.

In this course, students will learn the practical realities of working with spatial geographies in digital and web-based contexts. Time will also be devoted to investigating the conceptual questions that inform mapping and strategies for art-based counter-mapping. The course will address questions such as: What makes a good digital or web map? What do maps represent as visual information artifacts? What happens when we consider claims to space as topics for art-based investigations?

Students will gain exposure to a broad range of techniques in web and digital mapping, with the goal that they eventually focus on one or two. Throughout the course, students will be challenged to make maps (or map-based creations) that function as artful objects and challenge common conventions of the capabilities of maps. The class will be taught primarily in JavaScript, with assignments making use of git and Github. Other technologies taught will include mapshaper, Leaflet.js, Mapbox, and Carto.

## Expectations and Requirements
- Class attendance and punctuality 
- Participation during class discussions and presentations
- Weekly assignments + accompanying blogpost  
- Midterm and final project (completed individually or in groups)

This class is an inclusive and harassment-free space for everyone, with no tolerations of discimination based on gender, race, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or appearance. Please feel free to let me know privately if you have an academic accommodation.  

All students are allowed a maximum of two absences. It is worth stressing that because the class covers so much new material, it is very much to your advantage to not miss any classes, if possible. 


## Evaluation
Final evaluation will be based on the completion of all assignments, class participation, quality of work, and attendance. 

For homework assignments, I am more interested in your effort and attempts to understand and try the material than in you creating a 100% successful project. Everyone gets one free pass for turning in an assignment late, but only one. 

Some readings will be done in-class, but please make sure to do the ones assigned for homework, as they're painless, useful, and interesting.  

For the midterm and final projects, I am more interested in what you choose to do than in what you can do. We will elaborate on these distinctions in class. 

## Format 
Each class will begin with exposure to an interesting map or application of mapping, followed by students presenting assignments from previous week. If there was a reading/viewing assigned, the class will start with a brief discussion (no laptops open during discussion). The bulk of the class will be spent introducing and experimenting with more technical mapping methods and tools and teasing out the critical connotations of these objects and techniques. I will screen record the technical sections of class so that you can refer to them outside of class.

Though we will meet in a lab that has computers, it may be beneficial to bring your laptop with you to class. 

I can be reached via email at all times, but I am very slow to respond to emails sent over the weekend. If you are in need of a prompt response, please email during the week. I reserve 24 hours to respond, but typically will reply much sooner. 


## Syllabus
**WEEK ONE: September 6**    
Introductions to class and to each other, and getting set up for the semester. What is a map? What is the history of mapping? What makes digital mapping different from what came before? What are impossible maps?

*Assignment:*

- Go through [this](http://maptime.io/anatomy-of-a-web-map/#0) slideshow (it may take a minute to load properly) 
- Read the introduction to [this](https://www.justinobeirne.com/cartography-comparison) comparison between Apple and Google Maps. 
- Ask three people to make maps of how they get from home to Bennington. Bring them with you to class next week! 
- Post a 300-500 word entry about your thoughts on the essay or anything we talked about in class. Does it matter that Apple and Google Maps have different styles? What interests you about maps, space, and the representation of both digitally? You can write anything, but you must post to your new blog and submit the URL using the homework link (see above). All text, no need to have any images.


**WEEK TWO: September 13**  
*What do maps do? Creating our first webmaps; the anatomy of a wem ap; what the different parts of a webmap do and what they can be used for.*  
Screen Recording [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS6iPvvQcKc&feature=youtu.be).  

*Assignment:*  
Three parts to your homework:

- Read Borges and Baudrillard (see reading folder)
- Use the techniques we learned in class to **make a webmap**! You will need to:
  - change the basemap and add attribution (see [here](https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/) for links to other basemaps you can add to the map) 
  - change the zoom level, the view (lat/lon), and the max zoom
  - add a marker, a popup, and a circle to your map
  - **Get your map online in some form**. You can either take a screenshot of it and put it in a blogpost, or you can push it through your student server space. See or email Anna for help with this part. 
  - When you've uploaded the map, send the link via the [homework form](https://goo.gl/forms/GqT90flo8oHWEsg22). 
- Finally: download the Moves app on your phone (iPhone [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/moves/id509204969?mt=8), Android [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.protogeo.moves&hl=en)). This drains your battery like crazy (sorry!) but it'll be worth it.

**WEEK THREE: September 20**      
*Building out our webmaps; the differences between leaflet and mapbox; Understanding geodata and adding it to our maps.*   

*Assignment:*  

- Read [this](http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/47/bridle.php) piece by James Bridle about trap streets
- Learn more about geojson by reading [this](https://macwright.org/2015/03/23/geojson-second-bite.html) up until the section that begins with "Winding"
- Use the techniques we learned this week in class to **make a new webmap** or **build on last week's map**:
  -  go to [geojson.io](http://geojson.io/#map=2/20.0/0.0) and create your own geojson data. Use the omnivore library to add this to your map. 
  -  Use the mapbox [examples](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/example/v1.0.0/) or [documentation](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/api/v3.1.1/) to figure out how to add extra to your map (for example, how to [center markers](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/example/v1.0.0/centering-markers/) or add a [legend](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/api/v3.1.1/l-mapbox-legendcontrol/). Note: this is an exercise in learning to use the documentation. 
  -  **Get your map online** by pushing it to your github.io site. See the week three class notes file if you need a reminder as to the git commands. 
  -  When you've uploaded the map, send the link via the [homework form](https://goo.gl/forms/GqT90flo8oHWEsg22). 

Note: on the homework form you will notice that I've included a new question, where you can now check it if you want brief written feedback on homework assignments. 

**WEEK FOUR: September 27**  
*More geodata; design considerations and cues*    
[Screen](https://youtu.be/XHFB93YznOk) [Recording](https://youtu.be/YiQT7zOLB7g)

*Assignment:* 

- Reading: Trevor Paglen's "Experimental Geography" (in reading folder)
- Export your Moves json data from the [website](https://accounts.moves-app.com/signin)
  - If you didn't create an account before, you will have to go to the app and create one now (click the small M in the lower right corner > settings > create account). 
  - Once you've done this, then you can (finally) remove the Moves app from your phone! 
- Use the techniques we learned this week in class to either **re-make your map from last week** or **make a new map**.
  - Make sure to use the mapboxgl.js library. Use the documentation to load in a dataset that involves turning geojson points into circles. You can create a dataset in geojson.io, use the earthquake or community gardens dataset, or if you're ambitious, find your own (the NYC [open data portal](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) is a good place to start for just NYC data). 
  - Make sure your map has a title. 
  - As usual, get your map online by pushing it to your github.io site. Once you've done that, send the link via the [homework form](https://goo.gl/forms/GqT90flo8oHWEsg22). 

If you have questions: read and Google your error messages, check StackOverflow, check in with Anna, email me.  

**WEEK FIVE: October 4**  
*Continuation of design considerations; changing geodata into useful forms, working with multiple datasets.*

You don't have a mapping homework assignment this week other than to start advancing progress and doing work for the midterm (find the prompt for the midterm in the resources folder).

You do, however, have a very long (but interesting, and useful!) reading: [Mapping's Intelligent Agents](https://placesjournal.org/article/mappings-intelligent-agents/). Come prepared to discuss next week! 

**WEEK SIX: October 11**  
 *Recaps + working in class*

*Assignment:*

- Work on your midterms! Check the midterm document in the resources folder for more information on presentations next week. 
- If you have time, you can take a look at the SEPC questions I've uploaded in the resources folder. These are what you'll be discussing in class next week before the midterm. 

**WEEK SEVEN: October 18**    
*Midterm Presentations*

*Assignment:*

- Make sure to make a documentation post about your midterm. This should be online, and it should link to your map, and should include the information that was in your presentation: how you did it, why, what you set out to do, what you did do, etc. 
- Readings(ish):
  - read [Recognition through reconnaisance? Using drones for counter mapping in Indonesia](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03066150.2016.1264937) (use link or find in readings folder)
  - Catherine D'Ignazio's [Feminist Data Visualization](https://civic.mit.edu/feminist-data-visualization)

**WEEK EIGHT: October 25**   
*Aerial Mapping, part 1* 

*Assignment:*

- One of you needs to type up your plan for the in-class balloon counter-mapping exercise next week and submit it using the homework form. I will have it printed out next week for class. 
- Reading:
  -  read the chapter entitled "Representation and the Necessity of Interpretation" from Laura Kurgan's book *Close Up At A Distance* (this is in the readings folder as "kurgan2.pdf")
  -  skim these posts on balloon mapping so that you're more familiar with the equipment and what you'll be doing next week:
    - [post 1](https://publiclab.org/wiki/balloon-mapping-of-local-invasive-species-and-town-mapping) 
    - [post 2](http://geojournalism.org/2013/08/balloon-mapping-how-to-make-your-own-low-flying-satellite/)
