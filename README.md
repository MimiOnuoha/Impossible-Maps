## Course Description 

Digital technologies have created new opportunities and resources for mapping, cartography, and geolocation-based visual investigation. They have also brought with them the need to consider issues concerning power, representation, and space.

In this seven-week course, students will learn the practical realities of working with spatial geographies in digital and web-based contexts. Time will also be devoted to investigating the conceptual questions that inform mapping and strategies for art-based counter-mapping. The course will address questions such as: What makes a good digital or web map? What do maps represent as visual information artifacts? What happens when we consider claims to space as topics for art-based investigations?

Students will gain exposure to a broad range of techniques in web and digital mapping, with the goal that they eventually focus on one or two. Throughout the course, students will be challenged to make maps (or map-based creations) that function as artful objects and challenge common conventions of the capabilities of maps. The class will be taught primarily in JavaScript, with assignments making use of git and Github. Other technologies taught will include mapshaper, Leaflet.js, Mapbox.js, and Carto.

## Expectations and Requirements
- Class attendance and punctuality 
- Participation during class discussions and presentations
- Weekly assignments + accompanying blogpost  
- Midterm and final project (completed individually or in groups)

This class is an inclusive and harassment-free space for everyone, with no tolerations of discimination based on gender, race, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or appearance. Please feel free to let me know privately if you have an academic accommodation.  

All students are allowed a maximum of one absence. It is worth stressing that because the class covers so much new material, it is very much to your advantage to attend all classes if possible. 

Homework should be submitted at least **one hour** before class begins. This gives me time to look at your work, provide feedback, and structure the class in response to what you've submitted. 


## Evaluation
Final evaluation will be based on the completion of all assignments, class participation, quality of work, and attendance. 

Be sure to complete the readings assigned for homework. Not only are they painless, useful, and interesting, but the in-class discussions will be far richer if everyone has completed the required reading.   

For the final projects, I am more interested in what you choose to do than in what you can do. We will elaborate on these distinctions in class. 

## Format 
Each class will begin with exposure to an interesting map or application of mapping, followed by students presenting assignments from the previous week. If there was a reading/viewing assigned, the class will include a brief discussion (no laptops open during discussion). The bulk of the class will be spent introducing and experimenting with more technical mapping methods and tools and teasing out the critical connotations of these objects and techniques. I will screen record some of these sections of class so that you can refer to them outside of class.

I can be reached via email at all times, but am slow to respond to emails sent over the weekend. If you are in need of a prompt response, please email during the week. I reserve 24 hours to respond, but typically will reply much sooner. 

## Syllabus
**WEEK ONE** (March 20): Introductions      
*Introductions to class and to each other/semester set-up:  What is a map, what is the history of mapping, what the different parts of a web map do and what they can be used for, what are impossible maps?* 


**WEEK TWO**  (March 27):  The Perils of Web Mapping
*Slippy web maps, the differences between Leaflet and Mapbox and vector vs raster tiles.  What is geodata, how do we create it and add it to our maps?* 


**WEEK THREE** (April 3): The Battle for Data 
*Diving deeper into geodata, working with external datasets, wrangling geodata to meet our needs.*


**WEEK FOUR** (April 10): A Sense of Place (+ design considerations)
*Changing geodata into useful forms, working with multiple datasets, design considerations for our maps.* 


**WEEK FIVE** (April 17): Counter-Mapping as Practice 
*Exploring aerial imagery and the material experience of mapping.* 


**WEEK SIX** (April 24): The View from Above 
*Guest Speakers | Working with Satellite imagery, the Google Maps Static Image API* 


**WEEK SEVEN ** (May 1): Final Presentations
