## Project Overview

Your assignment is to use all of the things that you've learned over the course of the semester to create a piece in conversation with the work of one of the community groups that takes the form of a map, map-based, or otherwise geographica/spatial-centered object. You will work in groups of two.

Over the course of the semester, we've talked about a number of different interesting issues and ideas, and you've been exposed to a number of interesting technologies. You don't have to engage *all* of them. Choose whichever one has captivated you the most.

It may be useful for you to think of using this project as a way to answer a question, or advance some kind of knowledge, understanding, or inquiry (cartographic, spatially, artistically, aesthetically, culturally, etc). You will want to consider both intention and output, concept and execution. Consider not just how you will collect or acquire the data, but how you will communicate the project to people who haven't been sitting in our group all semester.

You will be working in pairs, and will have a small budget for materials (about $200/group). Don't hesitate to let me know if you have questions!

## By the end of class today, you should know: 

- **Who is in your group?**
- **Which community group are you in conversation with?** (Urbano, HSTF, or Sisters Unchained)
- **What is the theme of your project?**
  - You can think of this as a hunch—an idea, vision, question, or concept that's orienting your work — or as a concrete plan that you want to pursue. 
  - If you don't yet have an idea, feel free to use some of the below examples of potential forms, materials, scales, affects, and locations to get you thinking. 
    - *Forms* (examples: video, sculpture, website, diorama, comic book, collage). 
    - *Materials* (examples: concrete, plexiglass, living tissue, rice paper, cake)
    - *Scale* (examples: big as a house, small as a marble)
    - *Affects*/*emotions* (examples: clumsy, cheerful, morose, businesslike)
    - *Inspirations* (projects, people, contexts that inspire you to follow this hunch)
- **What is your next step?**
  - Note: you need to have something for class next week, so think of this week as a sprint. Just like with
