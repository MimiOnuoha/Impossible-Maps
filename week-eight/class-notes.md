## Class Notes 



**Orthophoto**: a photographic map 

Orthorectification is the process by which you remove distortion in aerial photographs so that they can be used as maps 



**Recognition through reconnaissance? Using drones for counter-mapping in Indonesia**:

Counter-mapping starts from the assumption that mapping is an activity deeply entangled in power relations. 

- Is it possible to correct and counter the one-sidedness/manipulation/silencing work that maps often do? 

  - still using Western tools
  - assimilation for pragmatic purposes —> necessary thing? 
  - "helping" people to feel empowered, but is it actually empowered 

- Can we legitimize Indigenous knowledge as a response? What does this look like? 

- Is it a very western thing? 

  - maps | aeriel maps | view from above

- Inclusion and accessibility 

- "The mapping process itself will change the perception and values of the ommunities involved."

  - Does this apply in 2017? Is this a western-situated perspective?

- power-knowledge 

- adding the contextual information to static images 

  - simplicity/understandability of frozen moments
  - choosing to exclude 

- Counter-maps don't have to counter *everything*, they just have to counter *something* 

- There's no perfect counter-map, but the more collaboriate it is the more inclusive it can be

  - Various ways that you can consider countered 
  - Members of the community are *choosing* it
    - Agency 

- The effect of process 

  - It's useful for the process to be collaborative (counter-process)

- When is it too much? 

  - What about privacy concerns? 

    ​

### Goals for counter-mapping  (or: what should a good counter-map do?)

 -  Counters some dominant source of knowledge

 -  A form of rebellion 

 -  community-involvement 

 -  tool to fight against something (maybe it can't solve the problem entirely but it starts us down that path)

 -  process that's as accessible and transparent as possible 

 -  there's no everyone

### Class Exercise in Counter-Mapping:

1. What are you going to map/photograph?
2. Why that area? 
3. What is the purpose? What are you hoping to achieve? What are you trying to understand? What do you want to display?
4. How will you judge the effectiveness? Considering the end products/imagery (opt)
5. Write it out!
