# Counter-Mapping Exercise

This is an exercise designed to allow you to engage with counter-mapping and art-making simultaneously. 

Working in groups of two and three, your  task is to use any of the methods discussed in the readings over the past two weeks to create a **counter-map*** **of Olin**.  You can consider counter-map in a conceptually, materially, in method, or as a combination of multiple aspects. 

##Questions:

 - Who or what is the subject of your map? Think of this in tandem with the question of what does it mean to create a counter-map of Olin? Consider the definition of counter-mapping that we unpacked last week.
 - What will be the output of your map? In what format will it live, and how will it be presented? This is as much a part of the work as the process and conception, so be sure to consider aesthetic questions. 
 - We are calling this an exercise because you have a week to do it, but you still need to produce something that you would be willing to show to other people. Be aware of this as you think about scope. 
 - Remember: you can be as specific or broad as you like. 

##More things to consider:

 - Who is the audience for your counter-map? *(examples: Babson students, potential Oliners, relatives of Oliners, people who will never come here, people who look at the Olin website, staff)*

 - What form will your map take? *(examples: video, print, website, paper, sculpture, images, projection mapped, etc? Is this a series of a maps rather than just one?)*

 - What will be the scale of your map? *(examples: as large as the side of a building, small enough to fit in someone's hand. )*

 - What would be the ideal context/location for your map to live in?  *(examples: the top floor of the library, the public drive, a remote part of Parcel B, the carpe listserv, a gallery)*

 - Why do you want to explore this? *(what is your motivation, underlying impulse? why do you think that this should be a map?)*

 - What is the affect you want to use or explore? *(This is where your aesthetic decisions can draw from. Is it meant to be slick, clumsy, cheerful, dark, playful, business-like, unassuming, whimsical, rustic, [insert your own word here])*
