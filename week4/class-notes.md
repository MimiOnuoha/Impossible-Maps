# Class Notes

## Useful things

- [Chloropleth Maps]( https://www.vis4.net/blog/2011/12/choropleth-maps/)

- [Color brewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3) 

  - sequential: values go from low to high, like population density or temperature
  - diverging: deviations from the mean, as in areas where unemployment is above or below average
  - qualitative: categories, such as different religions or ethnicities

- [Types of maps](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog486/node/1848) 

- [When Maps Shouldn't Be Maps](http://www.ericson.net/content/2011/10/when-maps-shouldnt-be-maps/) 

- [geojson-join](https://github.com/node-geojson/geojson-join)

  - the against field and id field are usually the same

- [Mapbox gallery of vector maps](https://www.mapbox.com/gallery/) 

  ##Reading: Mapping's Intelligent Agents**

  -  the use of AI in maps --> positive and negative factors

  - interdisciplinary approach to mapping (compsci, AI, ml, mapping)

  - fetishization of mapping for isolation 

  - what does it look to have more open maps? 

  - how much is our approach tied to the commercialization of maps?

  - what does it look like to map in fluid ways (that aren't related to property and ownership?)

  - - this is a result of who is mapping, and the politics of this

  - what does it mean to make someone else's map? (doing the place-making for someone else to benefit)

  - spirituality/ spiritual essence in space

  - can you not be political when making a map? can you make a purely objective map? 

  - - "the very decision to create a map is inherently political" - hafi
    - how do we live with the implications of the things we make? 
    - the individual decisions we make around this 
    - "you might as well be truthful with your biases" - luna

  - can we create different tools? 

  - - (the tools we have allow us to create the same kinds of maps)
    - do you have the luxury to not participate in this society? 

  - the difficulty in creating an apolitical map--what is the point if you're not going to benefit from it

  - embodying location and space without moving our bodies --> map-making is a cognitive process (ref: deleuze, little hans, map-making)

  - maps for machines aren't just for machines 

  - how limited are we by the technology we're using

  - if this imagery is so political, should it be regulated? 

  **How could satellite imagery be political?**

  \- the money behind the tools for the act

  \- who owned the land in the first place, and was it taken from anyone?

  \- who gives permission to take the pictures?

  \- how will the imagery be used? 

  \- who has access to seeing/working with the imagery (is is the same people represented within it?)

  \- is it part of a surveillance infrastructure/system?

  \- what are the levels of transparency in manipulation that could have been done to the images?

  \-  if this imagery is so political, should it be regulated? 

  **What do we mean when we say something is political?**

  - we make something more important than the other

  - the implication of power

  - anything that exercises power over anything else is political

  - hierarchy of information 

  - the perception of objectivity and neutrality 

  - are we aware of what went into the construction of the tools we use

  - it doesn't mean that it's not useful, or not productive. just that it is one of many ways

    ​

  - Can we codify the problems we have with maps?

  - what would it look like to codify the problems that maps can have?
