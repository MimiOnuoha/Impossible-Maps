## Wednesday, May 1

**Time:** 10 -11:30am (come at 9:30am if you need to set things up, be ready to go by 10)
**Location**: Milas Hall Mezzanine
**Schedule:** 

 - 10-10:20 - time for everyone to experience the work
 - 10:20 - 10:40 - Group 1 presents
 - 10:40- 11:00am - Group 2 presents
 - 11am - 11:20am - Group 3 presents 
As you can see, we're allowing some time in case things go over, but going with these windows of time so that you can get a feel for what the presentations at the ISGM will be like. 

**Details:** You will be presenting your work to the first round of critics (Sara, Robert, and Rhea via Skype). Make sure to prepare for this presentation, but I would suggest you not use slides as we'll be in the Mezzanine and you won't have slides for the ISGM presentation. Make sure to:

 - Give your work a title

 - Tell us what you've made 

 - Let us know which community group you are in conversation with (their name and what they do) and what aspect of their work you are responding to or elaborating on

 - Have a documentation post on your website about the work you've done (writing this out might help you know how to figure out the earlier three things!)

**Final Notes:** Rhea said to remind you all to consider the space. For example, if you have something that will hang it will have to be able to be proper up on the museum art wall's plywood planks, so design for that now! 

I've created dropbox links for each of the three community groups. Make sure that you drop in any resources that you've used or collected (images, datasets (not huge ones!), maps, illustrations, sounds, other raw material) into them. I've shared these folders with you, but you can find the links for them here: [Sisters Unchained](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ie7q92w15bubws6/AACAwBKRr1AMOeA-727W5LPEa?dl=0), [Urbano](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/jumavvw31dc9fx0/AABU5AavZ6sAjC4oqjBEVc8ua?dl=0), [HSTF](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zkf7nksft1e67ci/AAAdjscwM-wzrGFdoFYxWKbga?dl=0). 

If you have special needs for this or next week's presentation, let me know as early as possible!
