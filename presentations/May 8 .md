**Details:** Due to another event at the same time, we will be meeting in the conference room on the third floor rather than in the larger Education Room. For this reason, it's extremely important that you let me know if you have any specific needs for showing your work so I can pass the information along to Rhea and she can prepare. 

There will be about 6-8 stakeholders who you'll be presenting to, including members of some of the community groups, so come prepared! You won't be using slides, you should plan 10 minutes to explain and allow us to experience the work, and 10 minutes for discussion with the group. 

 Make sure to prepare for this presentation, but remember that you won't have slides. You should make sure to: 

 - Give your work a title

 - Tell us what you've made 

 - Let us know which community group you are in conversation with (their name and what they do) and what aspect of their work you are responding to or elaborating on

 - Have a documentation post on your website about the work you've done (writing this out might help you know how to figure out the earlier three things!)

**Final Notes:** I've created dropbox links for each of the three community groups. Make sure that you drop in any resources that you've used or collected (images, datasets (not huge ones!), maps, illustrations, sounds, other raw material) into them. I've shared these folders with each of you, but you can find the links for them here:  [Sisters Unchained](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ie7q92w15bubws6/AACAwBKRr1AMOeA-727W5LPEa?dl=0), [Urbano](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/jumavvw31dc9fx0/AABU5AavZ6sAjC4oqjBEVc8ua?dl=0), [HSTF](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zkf7nksft1e67ci/AAAdjscwM-wzrGFdoFYxWKbga?dl=0).
