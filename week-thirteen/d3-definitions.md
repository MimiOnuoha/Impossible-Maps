# Week 13: d3.js

## Definitions: 

**D3.js** - a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG and CSS.

**HTML** - Hypertext markup language. The language of the web, the structure of web pages. Characterized by tags <>.  

**SVG** -  Scalable Vector Graphics. SVG defines vector-based graphics in XML format. The vectors can be simple shapes, paths, or anything you can do in Illustrator. Though D3 utilizes SVG, you never have to actually write SVG code. (Also, here's a [great graphical user interface](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) for SVG. And if you are interested in using SVG on the web, you should read [this guide](https://svgontheweb.com/). )

**CSS** - Cascading Style Sheets. Used for defining styles on the web. 

##Back to d3:

D3 is all about taking data, binding it to HTML or SVG elements, and manipulating those elements based on the data.
