# Class Exercise

For this class activity, you will need to be in groups of two. Within these groups, you will be **pair programming** (to begin, let the person with less programming experience be the one typing).

Below are two different exercises designed to help familiarize you with different aspects of working with data. You should choose just one to work on as a team. At the end of class we will regroup and you will have the opportunity to share your work, as well as the challenges you faced. 



**Option 1: Understanding geodata**
Difficulty Level: 1.5

- In the week3 folder for class, you should see two files with the names "dataset1.json" and "dataset2.json". Your task is to answer the following questions by looking over the data and mapping it using the techniques that we have covered in class:
  - What is being represented in these datasets?
  - What can we learn from the data? 
- Things to consider:
  - Dataset2 holds multiple different types of data (including the data from dataset1). To make things easier on yourself, you might want to start by looking over dataset2, but by mapping dataset1. 

**Option 2: Sorting through geodata**
Difficulty Level: 2 

- Your task is to recreate Jill Hubley's [tree map](http://www.jillhubley.com/project/nyctrees/) in some capacity. You can find data here: https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/
- Tips: 
  - It might be useful for you to download the data and convert it to geojson using csv-to-geojson.
  - Numbers in geojson should be integers, not strings. 
  - It would be wise to limit this to just one neighborhood or just a portion of the data.
