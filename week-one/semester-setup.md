# Getting set up for the semester 

## Overview 
Even though the majority of the class will be taught in Python, we'll need Here's an overview (not exhaustive) of some additional, foundation things that we'll be using or referring to over the semester:

- **Terminal**: Also known as the command line, or shell, or console. It's an interface in which you can type and execute text based commands. It's just like Finder, but is another (often faster and more direct) way of interacting with the computer. 
- **Git**: an open-source version control system that tracks changes to a file. A tool used with the command line, useful for maintaining and referring to multiple versions of a file.
- **Github:** web hosting service for code. A place where programmers can share/store their projects and code, and interact with the code and projects of other people. 
- **Github Pages:** Public webpages hosted for free through GitHub. GitHub users can create and host both personal websites (one allowed per user) and websites related to specific GitHub projects.
- **Markdown:** a lightweight text format that exports easily to HTML (as well as other formats) and allows us to write using any plain text editor. This document is written in Markdown. 
- **Text Editor:** A program that allows us to create and edit programming language files in plain text. This is the place where we'll be writing most of our code. We'll be using Sublime Text, though you're free to use your own if you already have a favorite. 


This guide assumes that you have a Macbook. Terms in `monospace` are either code or things that you will need to type into the terminal and then press enter. Don't type the `$` that may precede some of these terms.   


## Setting up our computers 

We'll be using the console, or the terminal, a lot this semester, so you'll have many chances to get familiar with it. Don't worry if some of the things that we do in this guide are confusing to you, it'll all make sense in time. 

1. **Install homebrew** </br> [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a package manager for your OSX (the operating system that Macs run), it will help us manage programs on the computer. </br></br> To install, copy and paste this into your terminal window: `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"` </br></br>*Note:* if you get an error saying that you don't have permission to install this, you may have to sudo the command. That means typing in the word `sudo` before the command, and pressing return. You'll then be prompted to enter your password; type it in and press return, and be aware that as a security measure nothing may show up in the screen even though you're typing. 

2. **Use homebrew to install Ruby** </br> Type `brew install ruby` in your terminal. 

3. **Download RubyGems** </br>Go [here](https://rubygems.org/pages/download/) and download the zip of RubyGems. 

4. **Download Sublime Text** </br> Available [here](https://www.sublimetext.com).

## Setting up Git and Github 
Most of the resources and materials and our class will be available on Github. You won't need Git or a Github account to interface with those materials, but it will make things easier for you, and will be useful when it comes to the blogs. 

### Sign up for Github 

1. Go to [github.com](github.com/) and click the button to join or sign up for the site.
2. You'll have to choose a username, email address, and password. When you get to the next screen, choose the free plan. For now, you can skip the page about tailoring your experience.
3. Follow the instructions to verify your email address: go to your email account and click the link so that it's verified. 


### Download and set up Git 

On a Mac, downloading Git is easy. Just go to your terminal and type `git`. You should be immediately prompted to install. If not, go [here](github.com/) to download.

Once git is installed, we need to execute some one-time commands that will allow you to easily interface with github from the command line. 

NOTE: don't do these if you're on a public computer! Also, note that these values will be stored with Git, so make sure that you're okay with the email address being public. 


`$ git config --global user.name "YOUR_FULL_NAME"`
`$ git config --global user.email "YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS"`

See below for an example: </br>
`$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"`
`$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com`

Voila! 

## Setting up your blog
### Why Are We Doing This?
For the semester, you're required to have a website or blog where you respond to assignments, post your homework, and document your projects. You have a few options for this: you can either use Github Pages, host a website yourself, or use an existing  content management system (such as Tumblr, Wordpress, etc.)

I am going to be showing you how to use Github Pages, for a number of reasons. First, the structure of updating your github webpage is similar to the process of using git in general. Second, we want to use open-source projects whenever possible. Third, while the process might be confusing now, it's one that you can use whenever you want, so in the future you'll be able to easily host things online. 

In short, I think using Github Pages is empowering. But for newbies, it can also be a little overwhelming, so if you find things too complicated, feel free to use a different platform for your website. 

### How to set up a blog with Github Pages

By this point, you already have git and a github account, so this won't be too hard. We're going to be using [Balzac](https://github.com/ColeTownsend/Balzac-for-Jekyll) Here's all you need to do:

1. **Log in to your github account.** 
2. **Navigate to the Balzac repository** </br> It can be found [here](https://github.com/ColeTownsend/Balzac-for-Jekyll).
3. **Click the button at the top that says "Fork"** </br> Forking a repository means that you are creating your own copy of an existing repository (a repository is a directory someone has created of code and files). When you've forked a repo, you can do anything you want to it without affecting the original. 
4. **Change the name of the forked repository.** </br> Once the repository has been forked, click the button at the top for "Settings". Change the repository name from "lanyon" to YOURGITHUBUSERNAME.github.io. (Obviously insert your actual github username there). Then click the "Rename" button. 
5. **Change the _config.yml file**</br> We need to do a couple things in the configuration for the site. Click on the config.yml file, then click the pencil so you can edit the file. </br></br>Now delete or comment out (by placing a # in front of) the line that says `relative_permalinks: true`. </br>Next, change the Setup and the About/contact section so that they reflect your information. 
6.**Delete the CNAME filee**</br>
7. Now navigate to https://YOURGITHUBNAME.github.io. You should have a brand new site!

You don't have to use Balzac, here are a few other themes you could apply the same process to and customize (and you can always search for more):

- [Ghost Theme](https://github.com/GhostTheme/GhostNow) 
- [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)
- [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/)


### Adding a new post
There are two ways to add a new post. The first way is easier but a little limited. The second way is harder but allows for more flexibility. Once you've added a new post, you'll want to go back and delete the old posts that came with the site, so that it is clear that it's yours. 

#### Method 1: Posting through the github site
1. **In your repo, click on the folder that says "_posts"**
2. **Click the button that says "Create new file"**
3. **Make sure that you name your file in this style**:</br> YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-post </br> For example, you could title your post 2017-09-04-first-post</br></br>(The reason we do this is because if our posts are correctly dated then the most recent one will always appear first).
4. **Use the edit button to edit the file and write your post.** </br>When you're finished, hit the "commit changes" button. 
5. It might take a few minutes, but navigate to your site and you should see your brand new post. 


#### Method 3: Writing and developing locally 
We haven't yet gotten to this, but if you're ambitious and want to try, go [here](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now#quick-start) to the section that says "Local Development" and follow the instructions. 

Note that instead of `gem install github-pages` you may have to try `sudo gem install -n /usr/local/bin github-pages`.
