>"Technology in the service of poetry." 
- Zach Lieberman


**Things to remember:** 

1. All maps are impossible 
2. All maps are created to do something 
3. Maps are about exclusion



**Class points** 

- accuracy
- so much of it is rote that it was hard to document 
- you don't really make your own maps anymore
- i wish i could zoom out to see it spatially
- not filling in how to get between VAPA and Noyes makes sense because there are multiple ways to get there  
- it's easy if you know how to get there 
- access to spaces 


MAPS ARE: 
aesthetic scientific interpretive prescriptive </br>
(and scientific things are also interpretive and prescriptive)


**Themes:**   
If we are only as good as our representations, what happens if our representations are wrong? 

Where does GEOGRAPHIC DATA come from?

Who is responsible for mapping the world? 

abstractions 

what are the ramifications and benefits of being unmapped? 

we make sense of the world through exclusion 

what is missing?
