#Class notes - week 2 

can you mess up the data on a map so badly that it becomes interesting 

accuracy 
accurate to what? 
classification systems 
is this information that's interesting, necessary, or fundamental?

can a map perform? 

maps should be a right, but not to too much detail 

misinformation vs disinformation 

public vs private [security]

our modern-day phonebook--you have to opt out 

above and beyond who and what 

is it the mediafication of the physical world, or is it opening up the world to people who didn't have access? 

mere exposure effect (maybe this is the name?) - the more you're familiar with something, the more you prefer it.

(what do we want people to be familiar with?)
