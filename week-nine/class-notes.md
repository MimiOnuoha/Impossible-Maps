Kurgan, "Representation and the Necessity of Interpretation"

- Why is constant satellite imagery collection not threatening

- Interpreation of satellite imagery

- up close vs overhead view —> "ground truthing"

  - what are we verifying? does it work?
  - "seeing is believing"
  - should we call this "truthing"?

- how do you be transparent about the data without giving unhelpful information that most people don't know how to interpret? (experience vs information)

  - are there ways to build in access to the "source code"?

- What if every map was an axonometric projection?

- changing the pitch of the map as a way to change people's experience of a space

> The conclusion seems more reliable than the premise that generated it. The view up close can be just as blurred as the one from overhead….
